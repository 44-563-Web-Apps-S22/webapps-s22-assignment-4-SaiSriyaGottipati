    <p>SCENE III(Madame Jourdain, Monsieur Jourdain, Nicole, Lackeys)</p>
   
    <p>(The play opens with a great assembly of instruments, and in the
        middle of the stage is a pupil of the Music Master seated at a
        table composing a melody which Monsieur Jourdain has ordered for a
        serenade.)</p>

    <p><h6 class=" name  Madame Jourdain "> Madame Jourdain</h6>
        <p class="speech">
        Ah, ah! Here's a new story! What's this, what's
        this, husband, this outfit you have on there? Don't you care what
        people think of you when you are got up like that? And do you want
        yourself laughed at everywhere?
       </p> <br>
       <h6 class=" name  Monsieur Jourdain ">Monsieur Jourdain</h6>
       <p class="speech">
         None but fools and dolts will laugh at me wife.
       </p> <br>
        <h6 class=" name  Madame Jourdain "> Madame Jourdain</h6>
        <p class="speech">
        Truly, they haven't waited until now, your antics
        have long given a laugh to everyone.
        </p> <br>
        <h6 class=" name  Monsieur Jourdain ">Monsieur Jourdain</h6>
        <p class="speech">
        Who's everyone, if you please?
        </p><br>
        <h6 class=" name  Madame Jourdain "> Madame Jourdain</h6>
        <p class="speech">
         Everyone is everyone who is right and who is wiser
        than you. For my part, I am scandalized at the life you lead. I no
        longer recognize our house. One would say it's the beginning of
        Carnival here, every day; and beginning early in the morning, so it
        won't be forgotten, one hears nothing but the racket of fiddles and
        singers which disturbs the whole neighborhood.
        </p> <br>
        <h6 class=" name NICOLE">Nicole</h6>
        <p class="speech">
         Madame speaks well. I'll never be able to get my housework
        done properly with that gang you have come here. They have feet
        that hunt for mud in every part of town to bring it here; and poor
        Franoise almost has her teeth on the floor, scrubbing the boards
        that your fine masters come to dirty up every day.
        </p><br>
        <h6 class=" name  Monsieur Jourdain ">Monsieur Jourdain</h6>
        <p class="speech">
         What, our servant Nicole, you have quite a
        tongue for a peasant.
        </p> <br>
        <h6 class=" name  Madame Jourdain "> Madame Jourdain</h6>
        <p class="speech">
        Nicole is right, and she has more sense than you.
        I'd like to know what you think you're going to do with a Dancing
        Master, at your age?
        </p> <br>
        <h6 class=" name NICOLE">Nicole</h6>
        <p class="speech">
         And with a hulking Fencing Master who comes stamping his
        feet, shaking the whole house and tearing up all the floorboards in
        our drawing-room.
        </p><br>
<h6 class=" name  Monsieur Jourdain ">Monsieur Jourdain</h6>
<p class="speech">
 Be quiet, both servant and wife!
</p><br>
<h6 class=" name  Madame Jourdain "> Madame Jourdain</h6>
<p class="speech">
 Is it that you're learning to dance for the time
when you'll have no legs to dance on?
</p><br>
<h6 class=" name NICOLE">Nicole</h6>
<p class="speech">
 Do you want to kill someone?
</p><br>
<h6 class=" name  Monsieur Jourdain ">Monsieur Jourdain</h6>
<p class="speech">
 Quiet, I tell you! You are ignorant women, both
of you, and you don't know the advantages of all this.
</p><br>
<h6 class=" name  Madame Jourdain "> Madame Jourdain</h6>
<p class="speech">
 You should instead be thinking of marrying off
your daughter, who is of an age to be provided for.
</p><br>
<h6 class=" name  Monsieur Jourdain ">Monsieur Jourdain</h6>
<p class="speech">
 I'll think of marrying off my daughter when a
suitable match comes along, but I also want to learn about fine
things.
</p><br>
<h6 class=" name NICOLE">Nicole</h6>
<p class="speech">
 I heard said, Madame, that today he took a Philosophy
Master to thicken the soup!
</p><br>
<h6 class=" name  Monsieur Jourdain ">Monsieur Jourdain</h6>
<p class="speech">
 Very well. I have a wish to have wit and to
reason about things with decent people.
